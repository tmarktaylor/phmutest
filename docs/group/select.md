# --select and group directive example

Using the phmutest-group directive and --select command line option.

The first FCB has no directives and expected output block.

```python
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares)
```

expected output:

```expected-output
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Look for the `<!--phmutest-group GROUP-->` directive in the Markdown file.
Note there is a space before the group name.
The directive declares the block to be a member of test group "slow".

<!--phmutest-group slow-->

```python
from datetime import date

d = date.fromordinal(730920)  # 730920th day after 1. 1. 0001
print(d)
```

```expected-output
2002-03-11
```

## phmutest command line

This command line selectes all blocks in this file that have a
`<!--phmutest-group slow-->` directive.

```shell
phmutest docs/group/select.md --select slow --summary --log
```

## phmutest output

Terminal output after the `OK` line.
Note in the log below that only the second block is tested.
