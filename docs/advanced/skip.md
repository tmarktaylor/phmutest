# skip directive

The skip directive identifies Python FCBs to exclude from testing.
They will be noted in --log with result "skip" and skip reason "phmutest-skip".
This example does not have a skip directive.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

```expected-output
Hello World!
```

This example has `<!--phmutest-skip-->` before the FCB.

<!--phmutest-skip-->

```python
print("Hello World!")

```

```expected-output
Bad expected output.
```

The skip directive can also be placed on an expected output block.
There it prevents checking expected against actual output.
This example has `<!--phmutest-skip-->` above the expected output FCB.
It prevents the test from failing the expected output check.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

<!--phmutest-skip-->

```expected-output
Bad expected output.
```
