"""Check FCB rebinds a name passed as globs by --fixture and shares it across files.

On Linux run:

python -m pytest tests -k test_share_across_rebind --capture=tee-sys

to see the printing. Example output is shown below.

The name 'we' is added as a module global (sharing-mod adding= we, no_conflict)
by the generated test file setUpModule().

tests/test_rebind.py::test_share_across_rebind sharing-mod initialized
sharing-mod adding= we, no_conflict
sharing-mod names= no_conflict, we
sharing-mod-docs/share/file1.md adding= dataclass, BeverageActivity, cc, we
sharing-mod-docs/share/file1.md names= cc, BeverageActivity, we, no_conflict, dataclass
sharing-mod-docs/share/file2.md adding= bp
sharing-mod-docs/share/file2.md names= bp, cc, BeverageActivity, we, no_conflict, dataclass # noqa: E501

sharing-mod clearing= bp, cc, BeverageActivity, we, no_conflict, dataclass
sharing-mod is empty
cleanup-

The name 'we' is assigned in file1.md. The value overwrites the 'we' initialized
by the fixture. file2.md sees the value of 'we' assigned by file1.md.
The fixture cleanup function sees the original value of 'we'.

Just shows that the rebind in fo we in file1.md did not affect the original value.
The rebind affects the shallow copy.

To see the effect of rebind in REPL mode see test_globs.py::test_extractor().
