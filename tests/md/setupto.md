# Test sharing of setup-across-files

Names math, myglobs, and my_function shared from setup blocks by
using setup directives and sharing their file with
--setup-across-files.

```python
print(math.floor(10.7))
print(myglobs_list)
print(my_function(2))
```

Expected output:

```expected-output
10
[1, 2, 3, 4, 'A']
3
```
