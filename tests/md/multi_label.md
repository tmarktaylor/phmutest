# File with label directives. Some labels are on more than one block


## A block and its fences indented 4 spaces.  Phmutest does not see it

    ```python
    assert False
    ```

## First of 2 blocks with the same label

<!--phmutest-label one-label-many-blocks-->

```
first of many
```


```python
assert False
```

Note- the 2 blank lines above the above FCB prevent the
phmutest-skip directive from associating with the FCB.

## there is some text between the comment and the fenced code block

<!--phmutest-skip-->

some text prevents directive from associating with the FCB

<!--phmutest-label one-label-many-blocks-->
```python
assert False
```

## skip directive on output block

```python
b = 10
print(b.as_integer_ratio())
```

<!--phmutest-label my-label-->

```
(10, 1)
```

## Third of 2 blocks with the same label

<!--phmutest-label one-label-many-blocks-->

```
third of many
```

<!-- HTML comment-->
<!--phmutest-label FIRST-->
<!--phmutest-label SECOND-->

```bash
ls -l
```

<!--phmutest-label SECOND-->
