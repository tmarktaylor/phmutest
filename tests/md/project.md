# Examples of mixed code and session blocks

This file (project.md) has some example code and session blocks
including a Python doctest directive example.

## An example with a blank line in the output

Note no `<BLANKLINE>` directive in the output block of a Python
code block output block pair.

```python

def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello" + "\n\n" + name

print(greeting("World!"))
```

Here is the output it produces.

```expected-output
Hello

World!
```

A second FCB that calls the function greeting() defined in the first FCB.

```python
text = greeting("Planet!")
text = text.replace("\n\n", " ")
assert text == "Hello Planet!"  # this assert is in the Markdown example.
```

## Interactive Python session requires `<BLANKINE>` in the expected output

Blank lines in the expected output must be replaced with `<BLANKLINE>`.
To see un-rendered Markdown navigate to tests/md/project.md on GitHub
and press the `Code` button.

```py
>>> print("Hello\n\nWorld!")
Hello
<BLANKLINE>
World!
```

## Interactive Python session with doctest directive

Here is an interactive Python session showing an
expected exception and use of the doctest directive
`IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL`.
To see the doctest directive navigate to [project.md unrendered][1].

```py
>>> int("def")    #doctest:+IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ValueError:
```

## Session with `py` as the fenced code block info_string

```py
>>> coffee = 5
>>> coding = 5
>>> enjoyment = 10
>>> print(coffee + coding)
10
>>> coffee + coding == enjoyment
True
```
